## Flour options
There's more to whole grain than just wheat. Find your local co-op and explore the bulk grains. I've had great luck (and taste) with the following:

| Grain (per 100g of flour) | Protein (g) | Fiber (g) | Source |
|--|--|--|--|
| Wheat (hard) | 15.1 | 10.6 | [USDA](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/790085/nutrients) |
| Buckwheat | 8.9 | 11.4 |  [USDA](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/2512374/nutrients) |

## Steps
### Preliminary
1. Measure vinegar/lemon juice into liquid measuring cup.
2. Pour milk to fill to amount needed.
3. Set aside.
### Dry part
1. Mill just enough flour for recipe.
2. Sift flour into large mixing bowl. [^3]
3. Add Baking soda and powder.
4. Add cinnamon.
5. Mix (with wisk if you have one).
### Wet part
1. Blend eggs, bananas, oil, extract, honey/molasses, and milk in medium bowl or blender.
2. Stir wet ingedients into dry until completely mixed.
### Cook
1. Pour onto hot waffle iron and cook until done (molasses will give it a lovely brown tint).
2. Slather in maple syrup.
3. Enjoy.

[^1]: Fresh milled, if you can swing it. It really does make a difference in both nutrition and flavor!
[^2]: Make your own baking powder! Mix 1 part baking soda with 2 parts cream of tartar, then add as directed to recipe.
[^3]: A metal strainer makes a great sifter; fill it no more than 2/3 full, then tap it against the heel of your hand over the mixing bowl.
